# Titanic-KaggleProject
A project from Kaggle that predicts whether the passengers of the Titanic will drown or survive.

I created a Titanic dataset using the random forest model and fine-tuned hyperparameters to predict survival outcomes based on various variables such as gender, age, name, cabin, and more. The goal was to determine the likelihood of passengers surviving or drowning on the Titanic.
